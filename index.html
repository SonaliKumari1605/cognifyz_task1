        <p>The change of position with respect to its surrounding is known as motion.</p>
        <h2>Laws Of Motion</h2>
        <h3>First Law Of Motion</h3>
        <p>When an object is rest it will remain in rest, when an object is in motion it will remain in motion unless and until an external force is apllied on them.</p>
        <h3>Second Law Of Motion</h3>
        <p>The rate of change of momentum is directly propertional to force and the object will move in the direction in which the force is applied.</p>
        <h3>Third Law Of Motion</h3>
        <p>Every action there is equal and opposite reaction.</p>
        <h2>Equation Of Motion</h2>
        <h3>First Equation of Motion</h3>
        <p>v = u+at <br>where; 'v' is the final velocity of the object, 'u' is the intial velocity of the object, 'a' is the acceleration and 't' is the time.</p>
        <h3>Second Equation Of Motion</h3>
        <p>s = ut+(at^2)/2 <br>where; 's' is the distance, 'u' is the intial velocity,'t' is the time and 'a' is the acceleration.</p> 
        <h3>Third Equation Of Motion</h3>
        <p>v^2 = u^2+2as <br> where; 'v' is the final velocity, 'u' is the initial velocity, 'a' is the acceleration and 's' is the distance.</p>
